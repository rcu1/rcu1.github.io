I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Agroscope, Switzerland. I contribute to the [scClim](https://scclim.ethz.ch/) (Seamless coupling of kilometer-resolution weather predictions and climate simulations with hail impact assessments for multiple sectors) project. My main responsibility is to assess the impact of hail damage on winter wheat and maize production in the context of climate change over Europe.


My research interests include:
- High-resolution climate modeling
- Hail and lightning
- Crop modeling
- Climate change
- Risk assessment
